# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anand-kamble/mcp-instagram.git
cd mcp-instagram

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run with npx (automatically builds if needed)
npx mcp-instagram
```

### Option 2: One-liner with npx (after cloning)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anand-kamble/mcp-instagram.git && \
cd mcp-instagram && \
npm install && \

```

### Option 3: Direct npx from GitHub (if published to npm)

Once published to npm, you can run directly:

```

Or using npx with a local path:
```bash
npx /path/to/mcp-instagram
```
